#' Arrange alignment and save MAE ggplot chart
#'
#' Running this function will save your plot with the correct guidelines for publication.
#' It will left align your title, subtitle and source, add the MAE blocks at the bottom right.
#' This function will save your plot as a pin on rsconnect which will then be automatically included in the chart_upload_table rmd where you can easily download your chart outside of the VM.
#' @param x The name of the plot you want to export to rsconnect
#' @param source_name The text you want to place in the bottom left hand side of your side of your chart add "Source: to the start of your string to specify a source"
#' @param save_file_path The name and location of the chart you want to save
#' @param width_pixels Width in pixels that you want to save your chart to - defaults to 640
#' @param height_pixels Height in pixels that you want to save your chart to - defaults to 450
#' @param logo_image_path File path for the logo image you want to use in the right hand side of your chart,
#'  which needs to be a PNG file - defaults to DH logo image that sits within the data folder of your package
#' @return (Invisibly) an updated ggplot object.
